# Write a program that turns a sentence into camel case. The first word is
# lowercase, the rest of the words have their initial letter capitalized, and
# all of the words are joined together. For example, with the input
# "fOnt proCESSOR and ParsER", your program will output
# "fontProcessorAndParser".
#
# Optional extra question: print a warning message if the input will not
# produce a valid Python variable name. You don't need to be exhaustive in
# checking, but test for a few common issues, such as starting with a number,
# or containing invalid characters such as # or + or ".
#
# Test your program, and comment your code.
